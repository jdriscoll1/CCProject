//So what do I need to do: 

//Get the dir/urand to work 
//Create pixel structure
//Function that creates a pixel
//Create image structure 
//Function that creates an image (threading)

//Get shared memory to work --> Be able to add to, and take from, shared memory all that is added is to be taken

//Get shared memory to work with threading. 

//Get Camera add and remove to work 

//Get the MV5 Checksum to Work

//Get the compression and the decompression algorithms to work 

//Send the memory into the shared memory with the camera managers

//Steal the memory from the shared memory with the gpu manager and create the first queue 

//Create the second queue and get it to take 60 pieces of the first queue 

//Have it encode the data into a file which it appends to 

//And that should be all
